# Music Metadata Reader #
This aplication will allow you to extract audio tags(including title, artist and cover so far) from music with common audio types. Tags will be saved in a Json file.  
All output items can be found in "./output" (generated while running). Cover Images are in "./output/images".  
Based on crates: audiotags, image, serde_json
